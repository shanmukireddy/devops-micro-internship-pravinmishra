# Assignment 4 — Gotto Job: Backlog Refinement & Sprint 1 in Jira

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this 90-minute, time-boxed exercise, you will act as a Scrum team — or run in Solo Mode, playing every role yourself — to turn the Gotto Job template into a value-ordered backlog, estimate the work in story points, plan Sprint 1, open the burndown chart, and ship one small UI-only increment (text, color, spacing, a label, or a CTA — no backend changes).

---

# Task 1 — Roles & Mode Setup (Team vs Solo)

## Goal

Choose Team Mode or Solo Mode, and document how each Scrum role (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev Lead, DevOps Lead) was handled.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Jira "Create project" screen, or the project sidebar after creation

---

### Notes

Write one line for each role: PO (what you prioritized), SM (how you ensured process), Dev Lead (what you built), DevOps Lead (how you shipped).

Mode: Solo Mode
PO: Prioritised UI improvements that would most improve user trust and discoverability.
SM: Planned the sprint, maintained the backlog, and ensured Scrum practices were followed.
Dev Lead: Implemented the selected UI enhancement and verified it locally.
DevOps Lead: Committed the changes, deployed them to EC2, and verified the live site.

---

# Task 2 — Create the Jira Project (Team-managed → Scrum)

## Goal

Create a Team-managed Scrum project named `Gotto Job – Team <#>` (Team Mode) or `Gotto Job – <YourName>` (Solo Mode).

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Project created page showing the project name and key

# Task 3 — Create the Epic

## Goal

Create the Epic `Improve Gotto Job UI discoverability & trust` to group the UI improvement initiative.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Backlog showing the Epic panel with the Epic visible

---

# Task 4 — Seed the Product Backlog (6–8 Stories + Fibonacci Points + Ranking)

## Goal

Create at least six Stories under the Epic, estimate each with 1, 2, or 3 story points, and rank them by value.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Backlog showing the Epic and at least six Stories under it

---

#### Screenshot 5 — One Story opened showing its Story Points and acceptance criteria filled in

---

# Task 5 — Planning Poker (Estimate + Debate Notes)

## Goal

Confirm the Story Points (1, 2, or 3) for each Story and record brief reasoning for each estimate.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Backlog showing Story Points visible, or two or three Stories opened showing their points

![alt text](screenshots/story_points.png)

---

### Notes

For each story, explain in one or two lines why it is a 1, 2, or 3 (mention any debate, even in Solo Mode).

Story 1 – Update Hero Tagline (1 Story Point)
I estimated this as 1 point because it only required replacing the existing heading text. There was no impact on layout or functionality.

Story 2 – Improve CTA Button Colour (1 Story Point)
This was estimated at 1 point because it involved a simple CSS colour update. Although multiple buttons were affected, the implementation remained straightforward.

Story 3 – Improve Job Card Typography (2 Story Points)
This received 2 points because changing typography required checking spacing and responsiveness across different screen sizes to ensure the layout remained consistent.

Story 4 – Add REMOTE Badge (2 Story Points)
I estimated this as 2 points because it involved introducing a new visual element and ensuring it displayed correctly without disrupting the existing design.

Story 5 – Display Posted Date (1 Story Point)
This was estimated at 1 point because it only required adding a text label without changing application behaviour.

Story 6 – Improve Search Labels (2 Story Points)
I assigned 2 points because several labels and placeholders needed updating and verifying to maintain consistency throughout the interface.

Story 7 – Add Apply Now Button (1 Story Point)
This was estimated at 1 point because it involved adding a single button with a placeholder or email link and required no additional logic.

Story 8 – Add Footer Trust Links (1 Story Point)
I estimated this as 1 point because only two footer links were added, making it a small HTML update with minimal implementation effort.

# Task 6 — Sprint Planning: Create Sprint 1 + Sprint Goal + Scope

## Goal

Create Sprint 1, move three or four Stories into it (approximately 3–6 points), set the Sprint Goal, and break each selected Story into Build, Verify, Deploy, and Screenshot Sub-tasks.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Sprint 1 with the selected Stories inside it

#### Screenshot 8 — One Story showing the Sub-tasks created

# Task 7 — Reports: Open Burndown Chart

## Goal

Open the Burndown Chart and confirm it exists for Sprint 1. It is acceptable if the chart is not yet populated.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Burndown Chart page opened, even if empty

---

# Task 8 — Ship One Small Increment (Build + Deploy + Proof)

## Goal

Implement one small UI-only Story from Sprint 1, commit it, deploy it live, and move the Story and its Sub-tasks to Done in Jira.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — Jira board showing the Story moved to Done

# Task 9 — Retro Notes (Scrum Pillar + Value)

Add a retro comment covering what went well, what to improve, one Scrum pillar observed (Transparency, Inspection, or Adaptation), and one Scrum value (Openness, Focus, Commitment, Courage, or Respect).

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 13 — Jira retro comment visible

# Task 10 — LinkedIn Post (Mandatory)
