# Assignment 4 — Building Your AI Team

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build and configure a set of specialized AI subagents inside your project. You will learn how different models and tool permissions define agent behavior, and you will trigger two real agent delegations to analyze security and cost aspects of your Terraform infrastructure.

# Task 1 — Create the Agents Folder and Add Files

## Goal

Create the `.claude/agents/` directory and add all required agent files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VS Code sidebar showing `.claude/agents/` with all 3 files

# Task 2 — Compare the Agent Configurations

## Goal

Analyze the configuration differences between the three agents and demonstrate understanding of model and tool selection.

### Written Answers

#### 1. Why does the cost optimizer use Haiku instead of Sonnet?

The cost optimizer performs lightweight, pattern‑based checks such as scanning Terraform files for pricing configurations and suggesting simple optimizations. These tasks don’t require deep reasoning, so the faster and more efficient Haiku model is sufficient. Using Haiku keeps cost reviews quick and inexpensive.

---

#### 2. Why does the security auditor NOT have Write in its tools list?
The security auditor is designed to be strictly read‑only so it can analyze infrastructure without accidentally modifying or breaking anything. Its job is to report vulnerabilities, not fix them. Write access is intentionally excluded to maintain safety, separation of duties, and audit integrity.

---

#### 3. Why does the tf-writer use `inherit` instead of a specific model?

The tf‑writer generates Terraform code, and the complexity of its tasks can vary widely. Using inherit allows it to automatically use the same model as the parent agent, scaling up when deeper reasoning is needed. This ensures consistent behavior and high‑quality code generation across different workflows.

# Task 3 — Run the Security Auditor

## Goal

Trigger the security auditor agent and analyze the generated security report for your Terraform infrastructure.
